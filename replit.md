# Overview

This is a Streamlit-based web application designed to process student academic data from Excel files. The application appears to be focused on extracting and analyzing student information, particularly related to internship tracking and academic advising records. The system processes Excel files uploaded by users and extracts specific data points like student IDs and internship completion hours.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

The application follows a simple, single-file architecture pattern typical of Streamlit applications:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit web interface for file uploads and data display
- **Backend**: Python-based data processing using pandas and openpyxl
- **Data Processing**: Direct Excel file manipulation without persistent storage
- **File Handling**: Temporary file processing with support for both individual files and ZIP archives

# Key Components

## Data Extraction Engine
- **Student ID Extraction**: Targets specific cell (C5) in 'Current Semester Advising' sheet
- **Internship Data Processing**: Extracts completion hours mapped to internship codes
- **Excel File Processing**: Uses openpyxl for direct workbook manipulation and pandas for data analysis

## File Management System
- **Upload Handler**: Streamlit file uploader component
- **ZIP Archive Support**: Handles batch processing of multiple Excel files
- **Temporary File Management**: Uses Python's tempfile module for secure file handling

## Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Returns None values for missing data rather than crashing
- **User Feedback**: Integrates with Streamlit's error display system
- **Exception Management**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks for file processing operations

# Data Flow

1. **File Upload**: Users upload Excel files or ZIP archives through Streamlit interface
2. **File Validation**: System checks for valid Excel formats and required sheets
3. **Data Extraction**: 
   - Student ID extracted from specific cell in 'Current Semester Advising' sheet
   - Internship data processed from relevant sheets
4. **Data Processing**: Information organized into structured dictionaries
5. **Results Display**: Processed data presented through Streamlit UI components

# External Dependencies

## Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for user interface
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **OpenPyXL**: Excel file reading and writing
- **Zipfile**: Archive processing for batch operations

## Python Standard Library
- **io**: Input/output operations for file handling
- **os**: Operating system interface for file path operations
- **tempfile**: Secure temporary file creation
- **typing**: Type hints for better code documentation

# Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for Replit deployment with:

- **Single File Architecture**: Minimal complexity for easy deployment
- **No Database Requirements**: Stateless processing without persistent storage
- **Streamlit Native**: Leverages Replit's built-in Streamlit support
- **No External Services**: Self-contained processing without API dependencies

## Scalability Considerations
- **Memory-based Processing**: Suitable for moderate file sizes
- **Session-based State**: No persistent storage requirements
- **Single-user Focus**: Designed for individual file processing sessions

The architecture prioritizes simplicity and ease of use over complex features, making it ideal for academic or administrative use cases where users need to quickly extract specific data from standardized Excel templates.
